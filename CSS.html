                <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                    fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
                    specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the
                    structural content.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                    different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                    speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
                    alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</u>

        <!-- introduce the basic syntax, selectors and pseudo-classes of css -->

        <div class="textblock" id="Selectors">
            <h2 id="Selector">Selectors and Pseudo-classes</h2>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                In CSS, the basic syntax is like:
            </p>
            <code class=CSS_code>
                <span class= intextcode>
                something:something { attribute: "value";
                }
                </span>
            </code>
            <p><b>Selectors</b> are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.</p>

            <p>In this case, <span class="intextcode">something:something</span> is a selectors.</p>

            <p>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
                <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
                <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>

            </ul>
            <p>This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The CSS element Selector</h3>
            <p>The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.</p>
            <code class=CSS_code>
                <span class= intextcode>
                h1,h2 {
                font-family: "Comfortaa";
                }
                </span>
            </code>
            <p>
                Here, all <span class="intextcode">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="intextcode">&lt;h2&gt;</span>elements'font on the page will be set as "Comfortaa".
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>The CSS id Selector</h3>
            <p> The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.</p>

            <p>
                The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
            </p>

            <p>
                To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
            </p>

            <code class=CSS_code>
                <span class= intextcode>
                #codes_table {
                float: left;
                width: 30%;
                margin-right: 0px;
                }
                </span>
            </code>

            <p>The CSS rule above will be applied to the HTML element with id="codes_table".</p>

            <br>
            <h3>The CSS class Selector</h3>
            <p>The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.</p>
            <p>To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.</p>

            <code class=CSS_code>
                <span class= intextcode>
                .header {
                text-align: center;
                }
                </span>
            </code>

            <p>In this example all HTML elements with class="header" will be center-aligned.</p>

            <p>You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.</p>

            <code class=CSS_code>
                <span class= intextcode>
                p.header {
                text-align: center;
                }
                </span>
            </code>

            <p>In this example only <span class="intextcode">&lt;p&gt;</span> elements with class="header" will be
                center-aligned:</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Pseudo-classes</h3>
            <p>
                Pseudo classes are styles that apply when something happens, rather than because the target element simply exists
            </p>
            <p>The syntax of pseudo-classes:</p>
            <code class=CSS_code>
                <span class= intextcode>
                selector:pseudo-class {property:value;}
                </span>
            </code>
            <p>Some common pseudo-classes are showed below</p>
        </div>

        <!-- display some pseudo-classes of css -->

                <img src="img//800px-HÃ¥kon_Wium_Lie.jpg" title="HÃ¥kon Wium Lie" alt="fail" style="width: 240px;">
                <p>HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, chief technical officer of the Opera Software company and co-creator of the CSS web
                    standards</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim
                Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time,
                and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C
                CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential;
                he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.
            </p>

            <p>
                Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup
                Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement
                for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web.
                Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand,
                let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.
            </p>

            <p>
                As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web
                developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more
                complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb, made
                consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The
                browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The
                style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web. Robert Cailliau, also of CERN,
                wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe
                different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine
                different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list. Of these nine proposals,
                two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style
                Sheet Proposal (SSP). Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves
                Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser. Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the
                Argo browser. Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed
                from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).
            </p>

            <p>
                Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago,
                Illinois in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995. Around this time the W3C was already being
                established, and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end
                chaired by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML
                editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the
                project, with additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In
                August 1996, Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called
                JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS). The spec was never finished, and is deprecated. By the end of 1996, CSS
                was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in december.
            </p>

            <p>
                Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review
                Board (ERB).Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: HTML Working group, chaired by
                Dan Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working group,
                chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C.
            </p>

            <p>
                The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in
                the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12,
                1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.

                In 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This
                meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3 Text were pulled back
                from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.
